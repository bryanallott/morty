	The best way to learn is experientially. At least, that is, for me. And probably, for you too. So go ahead and play. It might not seem like much of a fun game but getting an idea of what you're in for with a loan is never much fun anyways. Of course, the real fun comes in when you start making all those extra payments. Then you get a very good idea of just how much you're saving yourself in the long term- and that can be fun!

<div id="help">
	Create a loan scenario where the <em>principal</em> represents the total amount you are loaning. The <em>start</em> of your loan represents the first month you will be charged interest on that loan. To keep things simple, the calculator assumes the loan is approved at the beginning of the month and the first repayment is based on a full month. The <em>annual interest rate</em> represents exactly that at the time of the approval of the loan. Note that interest rates can/will fluctuate over the course of your repayment unless you specify a fixed interest rate. The technically sounding <em>compounding periods</em> represents the length of time, in months, that you elect to repay the loan over. Typically, for a home loan, it's 20 years or 240 months.
	<br/><strong>Note</strong>: Loan data will be periodically purged. So feel free to experiment and create as many loan scenarios as you like.

	Now that you have an idea about how the repayments work, you can experiment with making advance payments to see how the loan is affected. In this engine, the initial repayment amount is maintained and the loan period is adjusted (shortened) accordingly. The earlier you make advance payments, the more money you save in the long run. Try it out!

Of course, that doesn't mean it's not to be trusted. This software was written by an Applied Mathematics student who has an idea of what he's doing. The plus side is he's been programming for a while. But if you really want to get an accurate repayment figure, best get one from the institution willing to loan you. They have all sorts of fees embedded into their agreements that will differ from the amounts calculated here.
